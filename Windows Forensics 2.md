# Learn about common Windows file systems and forensic artifacts in the file systems.
we will learn about forensic artifacts in other places. We will learn about the different file systems commonly used by Windows and where to look in these file systems when looking for artifacts. We will identify locations and artifacts to prove evidence of execution, file/folder usage or knowledge, and external device usage. We will also cover the basics of recovering deleted files. 

## What is File System
A storage device in a computer system, for example, a hard disk drive or a USB device, is just a collection of bits. To convert these bits into meaningful information, they need to be organized. For this purpose, computer scientists and engineers have created different file systems that organize the bits in a hard drive as per a standard, so that information stored in these bits can be interpreted easily.

## The File Allocation Table (FAT):
The File Allocation Table (FAT) is one of these file systems. It has been the default file system for Microsoft Operating Systems since at least the late 1970s and is still in use, though not the default anymore. As the name suggests, the File Allocation Table creates a table that indexes the location of bits that are allocated to different files.
#### Data structures of the FAT file system:
* Clusters
* Directory
