Malware is such a prevalent topic within Cybersecurity, and often an unfortunately recurring theme among global news today. Not only is malware analysis a form of incidence response, but it is also useful in understanding how the behaviours of variants of malware result in their respective categorisation. 
There we will be a practical introduction to the techniques and tools used throughout malware analysis - albeit brief,

#### When analysing malware, it is important to consider the following:
* Point of Entry (PoE) I.e. Was it through spam that our e-mail filtering missed and the user opened the attachment? Let's review our spam filters and train our users better for future prevention!
* What are the indicators that malware has even been executed on a machine? Are there any files, processes, or perhaps any attempt of "un-ordinary" communication?
* How does the malware perform? Does it attempt to infect other devices? Does it encrypt files or install anything like a backdoor / Remote Access Tool (RAT)?
* Most importantly - can we ultimately prevent and/or detect further infection?!

## Classified into two types
* Targeted
* Mass Campaign

### Targeted
A "Targeted" attack is just that - targeted. In most cases, malware attacks that occur this way are created for a specific purpose against a specific target. A great example of this type of purpose could be the DarkHotel malware, whom is designed to steal information such as authentication details from government officials.

### Mass Campaign
On the other hand, the "Mass Campaign" classification can be akin to many real life examples, and is the most common type of attacks. The entire purpose of this type of Malware is to infect as many devices as possible and perform whatever it may - regardless of target.
Companies such as Kaspersky to name one, track these campaigns (known as Advanced Persistent Threats (APTs) and often report on their infection rate and indicators, much akin to the real-life spread of a virus from the World Health Organisation (WHO). 

## The ultimate process of a malware attack can be broken down into a few broad steps:
* Delivery
* Execution
* Maintaining persistence (not always the case!)
* Propagation (not always!)

###  Delivery
This could be of many methods, to name a few: USB (Stuxnet!), PDF attachments through "Phising" campaigns or vulnerability enumeration.

### Execution
Here's the main part of how we classify Malware. What does it actually do? If it encrypts files - it's Ransomware! If it records information like keystrokes or displays adware - we can classify it as Spyware.

### Maintaining Persistence
It wouldn't make much sense for Malware authors to go through all the trouble of developing a piece of code that is capable of execution - just for it to execute and that's it...Gone. Unless you have a very specific agenda (Cerber).

###  Persistence
This stage is largely why Malware is so "noisy", Malware employs many techniques, of which we'll be covering in-depth much later on. Essentially, this stage is just to make sure that the "execution" is worth its while.

###  Propagation
If you can infect one device, why not infect more whilst you're at it? Again, this is another reason why Malware can be so noticeable. Host discovery generates a lot of network traffic, we'll come to this later.

## There are two categories used when analysing malware, these are:
* Static Analysis
* Dynamic Analysis

## Static Analysis Tools:
  #### PE Tools
    * Dependency Walker (depends)
    * PeID
    * PE explorer
    * PEview
    * ResourceHacker
  #### Disassembly
    * IDA Freeware
    * WinDbg
   
##  Indicators of Compromise (IOC search collector)
IOC stands for Indicators of Compromise; they are artifacts of the potential compromise and host intrusion on the system or network that you need to look for when conducting threat hunting or performing incident response. IOCs can be MD5, SHA1, SHA256 hashes, IP address, C2 domain, file size, filename, file path, a registry key, etc.
